### Sherwood Lab guide for using RNAStructure on the Virtual Machine

The program is set up on Sam's Google Cloud platform account, contact him at sammy.barkal@gmail.com for access. 

#### Step 1) Upload a .fasta or .fa file to the VM



1) Change directories from the home directory to where we're keeping the required scripts and the .fasta files. to do this type `cd ASOproj`

2) If you've used an ssh client to access this, you'll need to file transfer using your method's protocol, something like `scp`, however, you're most likely using this through Sam's Google terminal through a browser. Once you have the terminal window open, click the gear icon in the top right corner.
